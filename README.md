cryptoped test
=========
server to test cryptoped:
https://github.com/dtudury/cryptoped
and the github page:
https://npmjs.org/package/cryptoped

cryptoped is highly optimized for running pbkdf2 in a chrome browser.
it's generally relatively fast in other browsers too.  but depending on
your specific usage you may find sha-lite to be faster
https://npmjs.org/package/sha-lite
crypto-js is awesome, but you're unlikely to find it faster for any real usage

this server is running at:
